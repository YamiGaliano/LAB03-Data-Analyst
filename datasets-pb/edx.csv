Knowing the principles of contracts is not just a skill needed by lawyers, it illuminates for everyone a crucial institution that we use all the time and generally take for granted.This contract law course, with new materials and updated case examples, is designed to introduce the range of issues that arise when entering and enforcing contracts. It will provide an introduction to what a contract is and also analyze the purpose and significance of contracts. Then, it will discuss the intent to create legal relations, legality and morality, and the distinction between gifts and bargains. The course also investigates common pitfalls: one-sided promises, mistake, fraud, and frustration. With the knowledge of what makes contracts and how they can go wrong, Professor Fried will discuss remedies and specific performance. Finally, Professor Fried will introduce how contracts can create rights for third parties.The course's instructor, Charles Fried, has been teaching at Harvard Law School for more than 50 years and has written extensively on contracts. Not only is Professor Fried a leading authority on contract law, but he also utilizes a story-telling approach to explaining the topic, which creates a unique and interesting class experience.",https://www.edx.org/course/contract-law-from-trust-to-promise-to-contract,8,24

If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.

Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.Why Learn About DatabasesDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.Stanford's online offering in Databases is now available as a set of five self-paced courses:Databases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Advanced Topics in SQL (prerequisite: Relational Databases and SQL)Databases: OLAP and RecursionDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Semistructured Data",https://www.edx.org/course/databases-5-sql,2,127

By tuning into the needs of other people, we actually enhance our own emotional well-being. The same is true within organizations: those that foster trusting, cooperative relationships are more likely to have a more satisfied, engaged—and more productive and innovative—workforce, with greater employee loyalty and retention.This course delves into the social and emotional skills that sustain positive relationships at work. It highlights the foundational and related skills of empathy and “emotional intelligence,” also known as EQ, which refers to the skills of identifying and regulating our own feelings, tuning into the feelings of others and understanding their perspectives, and using this knowledge to guide us toward constructive social interactions.Drawing on research and real-world case studies, the course reveals how honing these skills promotes well-being within an organization, supporting everything from good management—managers high in empathy, for example, have employees who report being happier and take fewer sick days—to more effective teamwork, problem solving, and recovery from setbacks. The course also explains the psychological and neuroscientific roots of cooperative, compassionate behaviors, making the case that these are not just “soft” skills but core aspects of human nature that serve basic human needs as well as the bottom line.What’s more, it offers practical ways to strengthen empathy, trust, and collaboration among teams and resolve conflicts more constructively—with a special emphasis on how socially intelligent leadership can build cultures of belonging and engagement.The course instructors are expert faculty from UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, Dacher Keltner, Ph.D., and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, Ph.D., whose earlier edX course, The Science of Happiness, has been a global phenomenon, inspiring a half million students worldwide.

Scrum embodies the simplest and most pure approach to managing project work at the team level. Scrum is employed by over half of all Agile practitioners across all industries. While agile may have started in software development, many industries now use an agile methodology to deliver their work. The basis for agile, the agile manifesto, extends well beyond its origins in extreme programming and agile software development. Development teams around the world are now using kanban boards and assigning strong product owners to direct self-organizing teams to deliver on prioritized product backlogs. And nearly every new product has some sort of IT component and goes through an agile development lifecycle.While the Mastering Agile Professional Certificate program emphasizes principles at the heart of all Agile frameworks, in this course we start by learning the key project management processes, roles, mechanics, and philosophies behind Scrum. This will provide the basis for all understanding Agile in its purest form over four weeks exploring Why, Who, How, and finally What Scrum looks like applied in the real world. From understanding the agile team members, like scrum master and product owner, to the important differences in lean and agile processes.While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how scaled agile is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to begin your agile journey, which we hope takes you to the next course in the series on “Sprint Planning for Faster Agile Team Delivery.”Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Cities, nations, and empires from antiquity through the middle ages drew on foundational histories and myths for their identities, relating these narratives through generations by means of oral-storytelling and new writing technologies. These epics, story collections, and novels, which take a keen interest in heroic travelers, would eventually travel themselves, finding new global audiences as the first works of world literature. Tracing developments in language, writing, and literary genre, this course also travels in time, from legendary accounts of ancient kings to histories of medieval courts and early-modern exploration. We will stop to consider how all of these texts affected the history of their own eras, but also how they have continued to find new prominence and significance in ours.",https://www.edx.org/course/ancient-masterpieces-of-world-literature,6,196

There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioral economics and allows learners to develop a hands-on approach by understanding its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice. In three modules, learners will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behavior change, b) learn how to critique, design and interpret the results of experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.Understanding experimental design and interpretation is central to your ability to use behavioral economics effectively, and will set you apart from people who merely know about the behavioral results. After the first two weeks learning the basic principles, we will devote two weeks to studying experimental design and analysis, and the final two weeks to understanding processes for designing nudges and for helping people make better decisions.You will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on various topics like “does irrationality impact welfare?” or “what strategy is better for improving welfare – nudging or education?” Several leading scholars, policy makers, business people, authors and commentators will briefly join our debate and discussion sections. These guest lecturers include Professor Sendhil Mullainathan (University of Chicago), Professor John Lynch (University of Colorado), Rory Sutherland (Ogilvy Group), Owain Service (formerly Behavioural Insights Team, UK Cabinet Office), Shankar Vedantam (NPR Columnist and Author – The Hidden Brain), Professors Andrew Ching, Avi Goldfarb (University of Toronto), Nina Mazar (BostonU), Itamar Simonson (Stanford) and many others!This course was originally developed in 2013, and the field has changed over the past 7 years.

Translating these discoveries into drugs and diagnostics increasingly requires the establishment of for-profit companies, but funding for early-stage development of novel therapies is becoming scarcer, especially for therapeutics for “rare” diseases that affect small populations. The dearth of funding for early-stage biotherapeutics companies in the so-called “Valley of Death” can be attributed to several factors, but a common thread is increasing financial risks in the biopharma industry and greater uncertainty surrounding the scientific, medical, economic, political, and academic environments within the biomedical ecosystem. Increasing risk and uncertainty inevitably leads to an outflow of capital as investors and other stakeholders seek more attractive opportunities in other industries.By applying financial techniques such as portfolio theory, securitization, and derivative securities to biomedical contexts, more efficient business and funding structures can be developed to reduce financial risks, lower the cost of capital, and bring more life-saving therapies to patients faster. Thus this course will also cover basic financial analysis for the life-sciences professional; the historical financial risks and returns of the biotech and pharmaceutical industries; the evaluation of the science and business potential as well as the mechanics of financing biotech startups; capital budgeting for biopharmaceutical companies; and applications of financial engineering in drug royalty investment companies, biomedical megafunds, drug approval swaps, and life sciences investment banking.",https://www.edx.org/course/the-science-and-business-of-biotechnology,16,213

Agile can often challenge project managers in the realm of leadership. Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential? ****Instead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means. ****Great leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader. ****In this course, you will learn how this new style of leadership redefines and redistributes team roles by: ****While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today.

This course teaches the basics of computer graphics that apply to all of these domains.  Students will learn to create computer-generated images of 3D scenes, including flybys of objects, make a real-time scene viewer, and create very realistic images with raytracing. We will start with a simple example of viewing a teapot from anywhere in space, understanding the basic mathematics of virtual camera placement. Next, you will learn how to use real-time graphics programming languages like OpenGL and GLSL to create your own scene viewer, enabling you to fly around and manipulate 3D scenes. Finally, we will teach you to create highly realistic images with reflections and shadows using raytracing.CSE167x teaches the foundations of computer graphics. This course runs for 6 weeks and consists of four segments. Each segment includes an individual programming assignment:This term, students who earn a total score of 50% or greater will have passed the course and may obtain a certificate from UC San DiegoX.FAQWhat is the format of the class?The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.Will the text of the lectures be available?Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.Do I need to watch the lectures live?No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can ""work ahead"" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.How much does it cost to take the course?Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.What computer system do I need for the course?The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone. ",https://www.edx.org/course/computer-graphics-2,6,344

In fact, in some places, the increased productivity and rising profits associated with automation have directly impacted the availability of decent jobs. According to the International Labour Organization, more than 204 million people were unemployed in 2015, and more than 600 million new jobs are needed by 2030 just to keep pace with the growth of the working-age population. We also need to improve working conditions for the 780 million women and men who are employed but not earning enough to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. In addressing these core issues we will not only see increasing decent work opportunities but also more robust, inclusive and poverty-reducing growth.This course explores the past and future of work in the context of the SDGs, particularly SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It examines the state of income and employment around the world, barriers to employment, policies to promote economic opportunity, and the future of work in our rapidly changing world. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to achieving the SDGs, as are effective measures to eradicate forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. With these targets in mind, the world can achieve full and productive employment and decent work, for all women and men, by 2030.This seven-module massive open online course (MOOC) provides an in-depth look at the issues of inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. The topics covered include structural shifts in economies and work; informality, gender and child labor, the modern welfare state; the future of work, and more.

It's learning to speak to the dead. At first the book just sits there silent as the grave, but if we listen carefully then, softly at first, the poetry begins to speak to us and we find ourselves speaking to it in response. Dante is the master of speaking with the dead. He convinces us that the dead can tell us things we do not know—things we cannot discover about the meaning of life because we are still in the middle of it. He shows us that conversations with the dead can change the way that we look at life. You and I may not have enough imagination to explore the realms of death that open up in the middle of life, and Dante knows that no one can find their way through life without a guide. This course will help you discover the magic of Dante's poetry and Dante will teach you to imagine the deepest terrors and the highest hopes that are still undiscovered in your heart. Only then will you be in a position to decide finally, for yourself, who you choose to become. In this course, you will begin to question for yourself the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Comedy , which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the questions “who am I?” and “what meaning or value can my life have?” Dante struggled with the same questions before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. This course is presented to you through the MyDante platform, an online environment developed by Professor Frank Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS). Throughout the course, you will be asked to reflect on Dante's interpretation of freedom, how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and whether we might be able to find appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern lives. You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante's poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and genuinely contemplative. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity, and responsibility as a person.As a self-paced course, the primary goal is to giveyou the opportunity to explore Dante's poem as fully as their interest and time allows. A minimal expectation for an initial, basic comprehension of the material and successful completion of the self-assessment process would be approximately 75 hours forthis complete course.",https://www.edx.org/course/the-divine-comedy-dantes-journey-to-freedom,8,395

The phrase “out of sight, out of mind” holds true for many of us when it comes to waste issues. Once garbage leaves our homes and offices and factories, do we really consider what happens to it, who’s collecting it, or what impact it’s having on our environment and our health?",7668,Self-paced on your time,World Bank Group,OLC and SURR ,Introductory,Environmental Studies,English,English,2–3 hours per week,5,"Solid waste management (SWM) is a crucial function of local governments around the world, and directly affects public health, the environment, and livelihoods. However, rapid urbanization and population growth place multiple pressures on solid waste management systems, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, the urban poor are most affected by lack of access to basic SWM services, such as waste collection and disposal.Yet, the sector also provides numerous opportunities: Improving solid waste management provides a cleaner and healthier environment; improves livability for all city residents; and attracts new investment and tourism, which improve a city’s economic competitiveness, creating jobs, and new business opportunities. SWM also contributes to new sources of energy thus tackling climate change challenges. In these ways, SWM is directly relevant to the World Bank’s goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.Historically, the highest expenditures of local governments is in the SWM sector but – particularly in low- and middle-income country cities – the bulk of expenses goes towards collection and transport instead of treatment and disposal. Another challenge is ensuring the financial sustainability of SWM projects and cost recovery once SWM infrastructure has been created. The world is generating increasing amounts of waste, with large amounts (primarily plastics) ending up in the oceans. However, there is also a paradigm shift from thinking about waste as something to be disposed – “out of sight out of mind” – to a resource that can be used for energy generation, reduce the use and costs associated with virgin resources, and improve our climate change efforts.Given this background, this e-learning course is designed to look at the SWM sector, with a focus on MSW, from several angles in order to simplify concepts and promote understanding of this sector.",https://www.edx.org/course/solid-waste-management,6,417

It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on “Advanced Scrum” is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience. ****However, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as: ****In this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.This shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career. ****So how do programs ensure smooth project delivery? ****This answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it’s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes. ****While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope either completes your certificate with us or takes you to one of our most popular courses in the series, ""Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.""Upon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Borné d’un côté par des théories aussi foisonnantes qu’hétéroclites et de l’autre par des pratiques indéfiniment variées, le territoire du management est d’une richesse inouïe. Cela dit, le management contemporain reste encore à inventer. Pour y parvenir, le gestionnaire d’aujourd’hui peut puiser dans l’histoire des théories du management. Il y trouvera toute une variété de solutions pratiques et de regards interprétatifs. Mais parce qu’il n’existe pas une telle chose qu’une théorie parfaite, le gestionnaire ne dispose que de solutions partielles et incomplètes. Surtout, sa pratique concrète doit nécessairement osciller entre deux pôles complémentaires. D’un côté, il doit faire preuve d’efficacité et pour y parvenir, il dispose d’un grand nombre de techniques administratives et de règles de gestion qui le conduisent alors à penser l’organisation en termes juridiques, stratégiques, structurels et opérationnels. De l’autre, il ne peut pas se contenter d’être un technicien qui ne viserait que l’efficacité formelle; il doit aussi être profondément humain et inscrire son action dans le tissu social d’une organisation et du coup entrevoir ses dimensions politiques, symboliques, psychologiques et cognitives. Ce cours de management s’adresse à celles et ceux qui sont à la recherche d’une meilleure compréhension des théories et des pratiques du management. Il fait une large place aux exemples tirés de la pratique et se réfère autant aux théoriciens qu’aux praticiens.

Ullman,Advanced,Computer Science,English,English,5–10 hours per week,129,"We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called ""recursively enumerable languages""). We shall learn how ""problems"" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be ""decidable"" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and ""undecidable"" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.",https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory,7,553

Tackle the challenges in the transition towards a circular economy? In this course you will analyse what it takes to create a circular economy including sustainable supply chains.The transition towards a circular economy is one of the biggest challenges in order to create a more sustainable society. This transition requires circular thinking and an interdisciplinary approach, combining socio-technical, managerial, and environmental considerations.Right now we design products from cradle to grave: from production to consumption to waste, which is a linear model. But we should design products from cradle to cradle: in a closed loop whereby they don't become waste, but valuable resources again. And when we start thinking in circles, we might as well try to reinvent not just supply chains, but entire systems. Because that's what we have been doing with sustainability: we have been departing from the status quo, while cradle to cradle and circular pushes us to think outside the box.Cradle to Cradle celebrates abundance; it recognizes that people, just like ants and trees, are abundant and have a large impact on their environment. The challenge is to make this impact a positive one and we invite you to join this challenge!In this course, we therefore take a systems approach to the circular economy, considering different stakeholder perspectives, their incentive structures, and their impact on circular alternatives.The circular solutions will be assessed by using applied, as well as emerging, technologies. You will learn how to use life cycle assessment and agent-based modelling to assess the socio-technical and manageable challenges and environmental benefits of alternative solutions.Join the MicroMasters programmeThis MOOC is part of two MicroMasters programmes, Economics and Policies for a Circular Bio-Economy and Business and Operations for a Circular Bio-Economy.Both programmes prepare you for the transition from fossil to renewable, biobased resources and consist of 3 courses and a final project; the capstone:",https://www.edx.org/course/circular-economy-an-interdisciplinary-approach,6,571

In this course, you’ll take the first steps toward being a solid HCI practitioner and researcher. You’ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You’ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. You’ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You’ll learn three views of the user’s role in interface design: the behaviorist ‘processor’ view, the cognitivist ‘predictor’ view, and the situationist ‘participant’ view. You’ll discover how these different views of the user’s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you’re considering what goes on inside the user’s head, as well as in the environment around them. You’ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You’ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you’ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. You’ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing. You’ll learn the limitations of human sensing and memory and how we must be aware of the cognitive load we introduce on the user while using our interfaces. Cognitive load can have an enormous impact on a user’s satisfaction with an interface, and must be kept in mind as you begin your career as a designer. You’ll finally conclude with an overview of the major design principles in human-computer interaction. Curated from the work of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Ronald Mace, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood, these design principles cover revolutionary ideas in the design of interfaces: discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, constraints, error tolerance, and more. These principles are crucial whether you move forward as a designer, an evaluator, a front-end engineer, or any other role in technology design. By the end of the course, you’ll have an understanding of where HCI sits in the broader field, a grasp of the goals of HCI, and a foundation in core principles that inform interface design.",https://www.edx.org/course/human-computer-interaction-i-fundamentals-design-p,6,588

This statistics and data analysis course will help you understand the fundamental concepts of sound statistical thinking that can be applied in surprisingly wide contexts, sometimes even before there is any data! Key concepts like understanding variation, perceiving relative risk of alternative decisions, and pinpointing sources of variation will be highlighted.These big picture ideas have motivated the development of quantitative models, but in most traditional statistics courses, these concepts get lost behind a wall of little techniques and computations. In this course we keep the focus on the ideas that really matter, and we illustrate them with lively, practical, accessible examples.We will explore questions like: How are traditional statistical methods still relevant in modern analytics applications? How can we avoid common fallacies and misconceptions when approaching quantitative problems? How do we apply statistical methods in predictive applications? How do we gain a better understanding of customer engagement through analytics?This course will be is relevant for anyone eager to have a framework for good decision-making.

From bottom to top, we will examine the layers of product-market fit beginning with your target customer and transitioning through your customer’s underserved needs, your value proposition, your feature set, and ultimately your user experience (UX).Our process is an iterative, easy-to-follow guide through each layer to achieve product-market fit. This process helps you to articulate, test, and revise your key hypotheses about your product and the market so you can define and improve your product-market fit.Using the principles of Lean Product Process, our course is structured in seven steps: determining your target customer, identifying underserved customer needs, defining your value proposition, specifying your minimum viable product (MVP) feature set, creating your MVP prototype, testing your MVP with customers, and iterating to improve product-market fit.",https://www.edx.org/course/achieving-product-market-fit,4,661

It includes updated content, better audit and verified learner experiences, and bonus videos on key topics.The follow-on to this course series on “Advanced Scrum” is expected by the end of Summer 2020. Speed is by far the most sought-after benefit of Agile. First mover advantages, the economic cost of delays, and the enabling effect on innovation drive the search for speed. Agile offers the fastest means of attaining speed: managing scope. But beyond the hype over scope management, there are key principles of non-traditional task management that ensure the scope chosen is delivered as efficiently as possible.In this course, you'll learn how to drive speed into any project by selecting and limiting work-in-progress through agile planning and task management. There are two principle roles involved, the scrum master and the product owner. However, the entire scrum team needs to understand the principles behind backlog refinement, sprint planning, and execution throughout the sprint cycle.In this course we'll show you how to run effective sprint planning meetings that produce a sprint backlog ready to deliver on your sprint goals and release objectives. You'll learn the power of prioritizing backlog items, and why we agile planning and sprint planning isn't just a managed list you work top-down in priority order. Instead, scrum teams commit to achieving goals and work together to ensure the user stories that are highest priority get delivered in this sprint, so the upcoming sprint isn't delayed. This also means understanding your team capacity and how to ensure safe and on-time delivery of the highest items on the product backlog that actually matter to your customer.While this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how sprint planning enables hyper productivity in industry today.

Thurman-Columbia University Center for Teaching and Learning,Intermediate,Humanities,English,English,2–4 hours per week,49,"The course begins with a survey of the origins of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent in the mid-first millennium BCE, as well as its transformation in the first millennium CE into the Sanskrit-language-based Mahayana Buddhism(s) that permeated the monastic traditions and flourished in India until around 1100 CE, and that persists up topresent dayin East Asia, Central Asia, and Vietnam.  The Tibetan aspect of this course surveys the Tibetan and Central Asian reception and development of these Indian Buddhist traditions that occurred in two distinct historical periods: (1) from 650 CE until ca. 850 CE, and (2) from ca. 950 CE to the present.   During the first period, the Indians' and Tibetans' massive efforts to translate into the Tibetan language the Sanskrit and Prakrit contents of the great Indian monastic university libraries resulted in the reception and preservation in Tibetan of the most essential parts of what was destroyed in India during the Persian, Turkish, and Tajik invasions and occupations in the early second millennium CE. These translations also enabled that Indian style of Buddhism to spread into the Mongolias and the Manchu empire in China. In addition to addressing such reception and preservation, wewill alsosurvey the unique ways in which these Indian forms of Buddhism were further developed in the Tibetan and Central Asian cultural spheres (throughout their histories, and especially in the second period that began after the destruction of Indian Buddhism).   Finally, we will explore 20th-21st century manifestations and developments of Tibetan Buddhism throughout the global modern world. Although in the modern era Tibet itself has lost its Buddhist culture internally due to the Chinese communist occupation and cultural revolution, that Buddhist culture has been maintained and developed in exile and diaspora, and its worldwide spread is a remarkable phenomenon in the history of American and European forms of world Buddhism.Module 1   Module 2  Module 3  Module 4  Module 5  Module 6  ",https://www.edx.org/course/indian-tibetan-river-of-buddhism,12,707

Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers? AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises (Verified Learners only), to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",https://www.edx.org/course/building-containerized-applications-on-aws,5,711

Maxwell on leadership. The meaning behind this message is that as leaders of programs and projects, we need to be not just communicators, but effective communicators.Obtaining your Project Management Professional (PMP) certification or Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) or similar project management certificate is the first step. But, as you gain program management and project management experience, you realize that effective communication goes beyond what you learned in ""A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge"" (PMBOK). Gaining a program management certification or project management certification (such as the PMP certification) equips you with the necessary project management tools to begin your project or project management career. There is more to effective program and project communication than what is on the PMP exam.For communication from program managers and project managers to be truly effective, there must be understanding beyond what you learned from your professional certification. The communicator and the receiver must use feedback to determine how the message was received and if the communicator created the intended level of understanding in the receiver for the communication to succeed.In this course, you will learn about the Understanding Triad - know-what, know-how, and know-why. The Understanding Triad aids you in crafting just the right level of explanation for all your audiences. The Understanding Triad will make you a more effective program manager, traditional project manager, agile project manager, or certified scrum master.The Project Management Institute, Inc (PMI) teaches that project management communication is the transfer of information. The project or program manager sends messages to their project teams, stakeholders, customers, and executive sponsors. If the program manager or project manager believes that communicating a clear message is enough for good communication, then the manager may be fooled into thinking their communication efforts are complete. Even if there is feedback, the feedback is usually limited to confirming that the message was received as intended. However, communication is not merely the transmission of information. The difference can be days, months, or years of wasted time and effort; or successful, early delivery.Certified program and certified project managers earn 10 professional development units (PDU) as they learn how communication can make a difference in every interaction, and become a truly effective program or project manager.

We cover the early history of Buddhism in China and how the rising feudal aristocracy responded to the loss of empire by looking inward. In this period, the Qin forged a new, unified empire, discovered new ways of mobilizing the population, and introduced the imperial ideology of “Cosmic Resonance”. However, this early dynasty was short-lived and soon gave way to the Han. Though the Han struggled with many tensions — centralism vs. regionalism, feudalism vs. bureaucracy — it lasted much longer than the Qin and established a stable relationship between Chinese society and the state. Later, aristocratic culture and concerns around self-actualization became important in Chinese culture. Buddhism was also established in this period, and learners will discover how that religion spread throughout the country.

Drawing from a variety of perspectives – cultural studies, economics, education, law, linguistics, psychology, public health, politics, social policy, and sociology - we begin by questioning meanings of gender in different cultural settings and historical moments. What do the representations of our currently used categories such as man, woman, transgender, queer, cisgender, bisexual, or intersex mean in different contexts? How are conversations about gender taking place in Asia and how do they converge or diverge from those happening elsewhere? The course is a comparative, interdisciplinary and cross-sector conversation which encourages reflective thinking about practices of gender. It courts and questions the fixity of language, traditions, laws, and practices as well as the resilience of stereotypes, biases, and structures which perpetuate myths, hierarchies and discrimination. Unraveling the interlinkages between these conversations and categories equips you with the skills needed to identify, recognize and reject outmoded or biased constructions of gender as well as the power hierarchies these embed within social relations. We will examine why gender equity is so important and yet hard to achieve. We scrutinize social and legal constructions of gender which continue to operate as though gender is binary and explore a more inclusive approach which reflects the gender continuum within the context of entrenched power structures. Through understanding gender and its relations with society, we look for solutions to eradicate gender discrimination and gender-based violence. Additionally, as digital technology plays an ever-increasing role in contemporary construction of social realities of people, the course looks into how, if at all, these networked communities offer new expressions of gender as performativity and the ways in which these replicate, reproduce or refashion traditional gender categories and roles. Then we turn to challenge our everyday practices of gender and how they colour our approaches, assumptions, and biases (conscious and unconscious) about the ‘other’? The course invites scrutiny of the practice and performance of gendering self and others. At the same time, it is a reminder that gender is not just about identity but also about power. The course examines manifestations and causes of gender inequality and its inextricable link to structural and institutional forces of discrimination. To better understand the interaction between identity and power, we look at gender-based violence. The #metoo movement has exposed not only the depth and scale of violence but also unmasked the asymmetries of power. Power and privilege are enjoyed by a select group while the voices of others remain invisible and ignored. We conclude by looking at local, national and global efforts to address gender disparities in society in various domains. We invite you to reflect on the course materials and to connect them to your daily life.

While living in Chinese cities and surrounded by Chinese culture — a culture that was far more sophisticated than their own — the Manchus struggled to hold onto their identity as a conquesting people. We'll look at the last period of ascendancy for China before the modern era. We’ll cover China in the 18th century, under the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong emperors — a period in which the size of the empire nearly doubles. The Qing was the last dynasty before the foundation of the modern republics and sets the stage for everything that will come after.

Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.Why Learn About DatabasesDatabases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.Stanford's online offering in Databases is now available as a set of five self-paced courses:Databases: Relational Databases and SQLDatabases: Advanced Topics in SQL (prerequisite: Relational Databases and SQL)Databases: OLAP and RecursionDatabases: Modeling and TheoryDatabases: Semistructured Data",https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-topics-in-sql,2,760

Desarrollar software de calidad implica conocer los modelos que dan lugar a dicho software. Una Ingeniería del Software avanzada debe de estar fundamentada -como toda Ingeniería- en modelos conceptuales expresivos, claros y fáciles de entender y gestionar. Para que esa gestión eficiente de modelos sea una realidad, los lenguajes de modelado se convierten en una herramienta imprescindible. El ""Lenguaje de Modelado Unificado"" (UML, en inglés ""Unified Modeling Language"") es un estándar que permite abordar ese problema del modelado de software en todos sus niveles desde una perspectiva integral que el estándar en su conjunto proporciona. Entre todos los modelos UML el modelado estructural destaca por el papel básico que juega en todo proceso de desarrollo de software. El correcto diseño conceptual de un sistema software es fundamental. De la mano de un equipo dirigido por un instructor conocedor de UML desde sus orígenes y con una gran experiencia en su uso, en el curso en línea aprenderás a realizarlo y conocerás las primitivas de modelado que son relevantes junto con los diagramas asociados que UML pone a tu alcance (centrados en el diagrama de clases, el diagrama de objetos y el diagrama de paquetes).

The world population is growing and is projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050. How do we prepare for this and how are we going to be able to feed all these people? It is clear that the food production mainly has to come from improvements in agricultural water management on existing agricultural lands.Global climate change raises the pressure on supply and demand for water. Changing temperatures and long-term variation in annual precipitation amounts and regional distribution patterns require more ways to control water levels. In addition to the changing climate, cropping patterns are diversifying and field irrigation methods are changing. In light of all these changes in water demand, supply and use, the role of (subsurface) drainage has changed from a single-purpose measure for controlling waterlogging and/or salinity to an essential element of integrated water management under multiple land use scenarios.Join this course to advance your knowledge in drainage, drainage systems and solutions, and to help securing a sustainable food supply.

How does blockchain technology change the way we provide financial services, and how should blockchain technology be governed? Is FinTech creating risks in cybersecurity and how can technology help us prevent financial crimes? As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is developed and adopted, will human biases and prejudices be built into such mechanisms? And at a larger scope, should FinTech lead to a decentralized, democratized system of finance, or will existing institutions adopt FinTech strategies to cement their existing hold on the financial markets? Through discussing and attempting to answer these questions, you will understand better how the introduction of these technologies can benefit or harm society.

Here, citizens play an important role amidst governments, companies, NGOs and researchers in creating social, technological and political innovations for achieving sustainability.Citizens can be co-creators of sustainable cities when they engage in city politics or in the design of the urban environment and its technologies and infrastructure. In addition, citizens influence and are influenced by the technologies and systems that they use every day. Sustainability is thus a result of the interplay between technology, policy and people’s daily lives. Understanding this interplay is essential for creating sustainable cities. In this MOOC, we zoom in on Amsterdam, Beijing, Ho Chi Minh City, Nairobi, Kampala and Suzhou as living labs for exploring the dynamics of co-creation for sustainable cities worldwide.

Pero, sin incluir la muerte de una manera consciente, esta acción siempre estará incompleta y mal enfocada, por lo que la educación plena no será posible.La muerte es un tema que, generalmente, se ha evitado y ocultado en los diferentes contextos educativos. Pese a estar presente en el día a día desde los medios de comunicación y formar parte de disciplinas (Historia, Filosofía, Biología, Arte, etc.) y temas transversales (paz, medio ambiente, salud, vial, etc.), la muerte ha sido, hasta hace pocos años, un tabú en la educación.En momentos difíciles, asociados a pérdidas de seres amados, solemos preguntarnos qué podemos hacer por nosotros y por nuestros hijos o alumnos en situaciones de fallecimientos queridos. La emergencia sanitaria causada por la pandemia (COVID-19) ha intensificado esa pregunta, que ha cuajado en claustros y en conversaciones familiares. También se ha comentado en estos foros cómo nuestros niños afrontan las pérdidas con relativa madurez y entereza.La Pedagogía de la muerte es la disciplina científica que estudia la educación que incluye la muerte, por ejemplo, en la enseñanza, el aprendizaje formativo, el currículo, la metodología didáctica, los recursos, la formación de educadores (directivos, docentes, familiares), etc. Si la educación es una tarea compartida, no hay que perder de vista que la familia es un agente fundamental de la educación, también en este ámbito.En este curso se trabaja la comprensión de las posibilidades educativas de la muerte y la pérdida, ampliamente entendidas, para crecer o formarse interiormente, no sólo existencialmente. Se aborda tanto desde una perspectiva didáctica normalizadora en el currículo de cualquier etapa educativa, como del acompañamiento educativo desde la acción tutorial, cuando un alumno o alumna pierden personas significativas.Se considera la muerte como un imperativo formativo, desde la educación que la conciencia de muerte y finitud pueden generar en el alumnado. Es por ello que se desarrolla desde una perspectiva integradora de la Pedagogía de la muerte, desde varios ángulos: fundamentación educativa, psicopedagógica y antropológica, currículo y pedagogía de la muerte, recursos educativos y acompañamiento desde la escuela ante situaciones de duelo en el alumnado u otros miembros de la comunidad educativa, etc.El objetivo final es comprender cómo educar incluyendo la muerte y la pérdida de una manera consciente. Esto es, desde la causa del proyecto, que a donde apunta es a que no hay que educar para la vida –siendo como es, globalmente, un desastre–, sino ‘para cambiar la vida y haciéndolo radicalmente’, o sea desde el ego a la conciencia de cada uno de nosotros/as.",https://www.edx.org/course/pedagogia-de-la-muerte-para-docentes,3,825

Yet as our global population grows in size and affluence, both our collective demand for packaging materials and the waste we generate as a result will increasedramatically. Currently, large amounts of packaging waste escape formal collection and recycling systems and eventually end up polluting the environment. Moreover, their material value is forever lost to the economy. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimates that uncollected plastic packaging waste alone is worth somewhere between 80 to 120 billion dollars a year. So how can we improve packaging systems in order to capture this wasted potential? Clearly, the way we currently design, recover, and reuse packaging urgently needs a rethink! In this course, you will learn about the design of sustainable packaging systems. To do so we will explore the design and business strategies of the circular economy. Contrary to our current industrial model, which extracts, uses and ultimately disposes of resources, a circular economy is regenerative by design.

Gabriela González, vamos a viajar por uno de los descubrimientos científicos recientes más importantes, donde vamos a aprender cómo se producen y cómo se detectan las ondas gravitacionales y por qué lo hacemos.",8657,Self-paced on your time,Universidad Nacional de Córdoba,Gabriela González,Introductory,Science,Español,"English, Español",5–7 hours per week,50,"En este curso conocerás sobre las ondas gravitacionales de forma fácil y enseñado por una experta del proyecto LIGO; Gabriela González. Algunos de los temas que cubriremos: • Los astrónomos modernos combinan datos de múltiples tipos de telescopios para crear imágenes compuestas de objetos en el espacio. • Los agujeros negros son por definición imposibles de observar directamente usando telescopios de luz, ya que ninguna luz puede escapar de su extrema gravedad. • La única manera de estudiar los agujeros negros usando telescopios de luz es observar cualquier gas y polvo que caiga en ellos. Esto puede revelar información sobre un agujero, como la frecuencia con la que gira alrededor de su eje. Comprensión de la gravedad. • En el siglo XVII, Isaac Newton propuso una ley universal de gravitación que concebía la gravedad como una fuerza entre dos masas (m1m1 y m2m2) separadas por una distancia rr según la ecuación: F = Gm1m2r2F = Gm1m2r2 • La teoría de Newton es muy exacta para la mayoría de las situaciones y es ampliamente utilizada hoy en día. Sin embargo, Newton estaba preocupado por la acción a distancia, quería entender cómo dos masas se conocen y se influyen mutuamente sin enviar ninguna señal. • Este problema no se resolvió hasta que Albert Einstein propuso la relatividad general en 1916. En su nueva concepción la gravedad no es una fuerza, sino la geometría del espacio-tiempo. Los objetos masivos causan que el espacio-tiempo se curve, y esta curvatura es lo que influye en el movimiento de otros objetos en el espacio-tiempo. El mensajero gravitacional de Newton resultó ser el espacio-tiempo en sí. • Einstein se dio cuenta de que objetos masivos (no esféricamente simétricos) sometidos a aceleración u oscilación producirían distorsiones que se extenderían a través del espacio-tiempo como ondulaciones en un estanque. Estas ondulaciones se llaman ondas gravitacionales. • Al igual que las ondas electromagnéticas, las ondas gravitatorias transportan energía y tienen amplitudes (llamadas tensión para las ondas gravitacionales) y frecuencias asociadas con ellas. Las ondas gravitatorias se representan a menudo como formas de onda, que demuestran su frecuencia y amplitud mientras que cambian con el tiempo. • Las ondas gravitacionales interactúan muy débilmente con la materia, pasando por todo esencialmente sin cambios. Esto es muy útil para la astronomía porque significa que cualquier señal detectada permanece prácticamente inalterada desde cuando se generó en la fuente.Hace no mucho tiempo, hace apenas un par de años, anunciamos en el 2016, que habíamos descubierto por primera vez ondas gravitacionales. En introducción a ondas gravitacionales vamos a explicar su significado, son una predicción de la teoría de Einstein de la teoría de la relatividad general, vamos hablar de la primera teoría de la relatividad especial después de la relatividad general y de cómo se producen o cómo pensaba Albert Einstein que se producían las ondas gravitacionales. Después vamos a hablar de qué sistemas producen ondas gravitacionales, en realidad no sabemos producir nosotros ondas gravitacionales, sabemos que hay sistemas astrofísicos que producen las ondas gravitacionales. Es así que hablaremos de agujeros negros, de estrellas de neutrones, del universo temprano produciendo ondas gravitacionales. Más tarde hablaremos de cómo se pueden detectar las ondas gravitacionales, que ha sido una campaña muy difícil que ha tomado casi medio siglo; Pero hay detectores de distintos tipos, vamos a explicar los distintos tipos de detectores, y más en detalle los detectores que se usaron para detectar por primera vez, por segunda y por tercera vez, también, ondas gravitacionales. Y finalmente, el tema más interesante, es la astrofísica de las ondas gravitacionales que aprendemos porqué las buscamos, y cómo podemos aprender de los sistemas que las producen, no solo midiendo ondas gravitacionales con distintos instrumentos, sino también midiendo otras ondas, ondas electromagnéticas, u otras partículas producidas por los mismos sistemas.",https://www.edx.org/course/introduccion-a-las-ondas-gravitacionales,4,966
